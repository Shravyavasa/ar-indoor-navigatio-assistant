🧭 AR Indoor Navigation Assistant
An Augmented Reality (AR) based Indoor Navigation System designed to help users easily navigate complex indoor environments like malls, airports, hospitals, or universities using real-time AR visual guidance.

Project Overview
Finding the right location within large indoor spaces can be confusing and time-consuming. Our AR Indoor Navigation Assistant provides step-by-step navigation through an intuitive AR interface, overlaying virtual directional cues (like arrows and markers) directly on the real-world view using a smartphone camera.
This project was developed as part of a hackathon under the theme “Reimagining Customer Experience with Emerging Technologies.”

🎯 Key Features
.AR-based Route Visualization: Real-time navigation using AR overlays for intuitive guidance.
.Indoor Map Integration: 2D/3D floor plan mapping with location tracking.
. Beacon/Wi-Fi Positioning: Determines user’s current position indoors where GPS is unreliable.
.Pathfinding Algorithm: Optimized shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm or A*.
.Dynamic Updates: Adjusts routes in real time based on user movement.
